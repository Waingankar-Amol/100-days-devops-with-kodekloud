# Day 4
##### Task : In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter. 
Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.

``` sudo chmod +x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh```

#### Explanation : 
```chmod``` command will update the file permissions.  and `+` is will add and `x` will add the executable permission.
