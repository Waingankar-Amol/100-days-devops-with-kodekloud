3. Once logged in, locate the Git repository named sarah/story-blog and fork it under the jon user.

**Step 1** — Open Gitea UI

In the KodeKloud lab environment:

- Click Gitea UI button in the top bar.
This opens the Gitea web interface in a new browser tab.

**Step 2** — Log in as the new developer (jon)

In the Gitea login page:

- Username: jon
- Password: Jon_pass123

Click Sign In.

**Step 3** — Locate the repository to fork

Once logged in:

- Click the Explore menu at the top.
- Select Repositories.
- In the search box, type:

`sarah/story-blog`


Or scroll through the repo list until you find:

`sarah/story-blog`

Click on that repository.

**Step 4** — Fork the repository under jon

Inside the repository page:

- Look for the Fork button on the top right of the repo page.
- Click Fork.
- When prompted, choose jon as the owner (your logged-in user).
- Click Fork Repository.

Gitea will now create:

`jon/story-blog`

This means Jon has his own copy and can start working independently.
